It is apparent for us that Twitter as we know it ends. The inability to bring cryptographic assurance leads to the program's behavior, which we, as a society, must not accept.

Last week we switched our focus a bit to create ultimately [useful example of the app]() on top of Cyber protocol. We created a twitter. It is hardcore crypto-anarchist twitter. It can work now as an anti-fake and anti-censorship tool for change with military grade security.

Nevertheless, there on Earth would you want to use the new twitter instead of the old one? So we decided to start from principles that are primarily important for ourselves. We believe they will guide you to decide to join us.

## Content is the King

We remove everything except the content itself. We believe this approach will help us be less biased while discovering our feeds. Hence no avatars, names, retweets, or likes. Just the content itself, because the content is the king. Examples of sparks:

## Censorship is the Past

You can tweet about politics, religion, torrents, black, masters, copyright, gays, copyleft, porn ... You got the idea. We assume that the information must not be prohibited. Instead, we are offering the model of the assessment by community based on evolutionary principles.

## Content is Yours

You publish your tweets and any content to your node in the ipfs network. Cyber blockchain works as a tool for linking the content with targeted semantics. Content is yours, and you are responsible for your content. This content is not locked and can be used in any application, forever.

## The Feed is Yours

Your main feed delivers strictly only stuff you subscribed to. We are tired of feeds which are fooling us and trying to sell us some shit. We feel that we smart enough to decide what we want to read and what we do not.

## Ranking as Intuition, not Cognition

The ranking mechanism of Cyber is economically resistant to Sybil behavior. Relecance is the thing which has been massevly exploited recently. Even though cyberrank is a very robust relevance mechanism, we believe it should be used carefully, as a mechanism to enhance intuition, and not as an outsource of cognitive ability.

## Social ~~or~~ Search

In the existing paradigm, you have a social network as one app and search capabilities as the other. We offer you one convenient app for both. As long as we know, this is brand new, and it is sooo fffucking cooooool.

You can start to find your mentors while searching for the content you are interested in. Any piece of content has its own unique community of like-minded persons, persons who care.

## Programmatic Control

One digital signature is an order of magnitude more secure than the conventional approach. But because one key can be easily compromised, it is not as secure as we wish. Multisig control is the only way to ensure that some crazy shit will never appear on your feed for millions of people who trust you.

As far as we know, this is the first tweet in the history of humanity, which has been published using a multi-signature account. This brings us the confidence and power for change.


And this is just the beginning. Cyber protocol offer powerful apps on top of [its knowledge](https://cyber.page/brain/knowledge) using [CosmWasm](https://www.cosmwasm.com/) Might and [Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) Magic. Hackers are welcome to deploy programs in Rust right now.

## Conclusion

Enjoy the new feeling with us! The feeling of Great Web!
